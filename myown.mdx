Although I am not sure this will be a good blog for my whole college life but I try my best . As from 2021 I started my engineering from college Netaji Subhash Engineering College and it continues till 2025.

Now from 1st  year to final year I got many friends but many of them are lost as they are divided the classes through university roll no. But Although I got some good friends like Aditya Singh, Anurag Singh ,Sayan Bhattacharya, Sagnik ,
Suchismita Sharma ,Arunjyoti debnath like this .


Now through all these years  although I can not know very much even I think I know about 20% of any subjects which are in my semester exam related subjects but I gain some knowledge about other things like :

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- REACT 
- MONGODB
- NEXT JS
- GOOGLE CLOUD ARCADE
- C++
- PYTHON
- C

This are all the things I learn and I also made some good projects with HTML,CSS,JS also using React and tailwind css I make some good projects like ->

1. My one of the biggest project till now with simple HTML,CSS and JS a travel website and I try to continou this project for my final year project also with proper backend and other things will be added ->
[Travel World](https://travel-world-zeta.vercel.app/index.html)

2. Also there some projects which are made with React ,Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI ->
[Video and Gaming](https://preject2-npx.vercel.app/)

3. My first Apprite Blog which is also made with React and this takes a long time to build and I made with the knowledge from Hitesh Sir Chai aur Code YT Channel there is a great React series ->
[Appwrite Blog ](https://appwrite-blog-three.vercel.app/)


This are not all about I till learning  but for my bad luck or something I did't get any internship till now so I need to do some or at least 1 Internship and I try to find one now see what will happen.

My luck in this college day by day is more critical though I can not got to college more than 2 months and still I do nothing in my house staying just even I don't klnow what I do .


So , stay tuned more things are coming as my college life is not over yet ðŸ˜Žâœ¨.
